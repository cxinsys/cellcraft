## Overview

CellCraft is a web-based platform designed for researchers to reconstruct Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) efficiently. It provides a **visual programming interface**, enabling non-programmers to conduct complex GRN analysis. Powered by **TENET** and **FastTENET**, the platform ensures high-performance GRN reconstruction. Docker-based deployment simplifies setup and facilitates seamless local server operations.

## Key Features
- **Visual Programming Interface**: Streamline data analysis with an intuitive drag-and-drop GUI.
- **Powerful GRN Tools**: Built-in support for TENET and FastTENET for cutting-edge GRN inference.
- **Plugin Support**: Extend functionality by integrating custom plugins.
- **Data Management**: Effortlessly manage and share data in collaborative environments.
- **Docker-Ready Deployment**: Deploy with ease using Docker containers for consistency and scalability.
